# CommServer software migration open source

This project is aimed at CommServer software migration from [CommServer](http://www.commsvr.com/) to GitHub and publishing it as the open-source (OS). The project will be used to manage the migration process of transferring software from an on-premise subversion repository to a set of GitHub repositories.
