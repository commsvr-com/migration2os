# Contributing

I strongly encourage community participation and contribution to this project. First, please fork the repository and commit your changes there. 
Once happy with your changes you can generate a 'pull request'.

You must agree to the contributor license agreement before I can accept your changes. You can preview CLA [here](https://github.com/commsvr-com/migration2os/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Contributing Process

1. If you haven't already, click the "Fork" button on the right side of the title to make a copy of the repo.
2. Make changes as you see fit (in yourName/migration2os), either online or offline
3. Once you're done, head into GitHub, click the "Pull requests" button under the title of the repo
4. Create a new pull request, merging the head repository (yourName/migration2os) to base repository (commsvr-com/migration2os), reference the issue if required.
5. Sit back, and wait for response from the devs.

If this is your first time, you may want to head [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) for a more in-depth guide on how to contribute.
